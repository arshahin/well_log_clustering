# well_log_clustering using k-mean, Spectral, Gaussian mixture, etc. 

This is a package for clustering of well logs using different clustering algorithms.

Currently, the following methods are included:

Kmean clustering
Spectral clustering
Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering
C-fuzzy clustering 
DBSCAN clustering 
Self Organized Map (SOM) clustering 


There are few steps of data pre-processing applied before implemneting clutering. Those are:

Data QC
Remove nulls
Remove outliers
Transforming data to [0 1]
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Scatter plots, Density plots, Correlation Study, PCA, etc. 



Contribution are welcome to include new data sets and other types of clustering methods. 
Converting the codes to other programming languages are also welcome.


Please make sure to check the PDF file and pictures provided to give you an idea of different visualizations that you can reproduce.
